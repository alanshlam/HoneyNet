# Project: HoneyNet and DFIR

## Project Overview
This project involves the deployment of honeypots to collect malware files and monitor hacker activities. The data gathered from these honeypots are analyzed in the Digital Forensic Lab within the Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) framework. Additionally, hacking patterns identified in the Penetration Testing lab are studied in the Digital Forensic Lab.

## Findings and Studies

### T-Pot Honeypot Deployment

We have deployed the T-Pot honeypot on a cloud platform to collect malware files and monitor hacker activities. The following screenshot provides an overview of the top 10 attacks, attack map, attackers' OS distribution, attackers by country, username and password tag cloud, attackers' autonomous systems (AS) and source IPs, detected Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and Suricata IDS alerts over the past 4 weeks.
